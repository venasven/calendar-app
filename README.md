# Calander Application

## Description
The code contained features a dynamic daily planner. Each of the sections changes colors depending on the current time. Grey is past, Red is present, and Green is future. The application also includes the ability to draw from local storage so any content added to the different hour boxes can be saved using the save button shown on the right hand side of the box. When the page is reloaded, the content written will persist.
